Linked Lists
- A linked list is a data structure that represents a sequence of nodes. In a singly linked
  list, each node points to the next node. In a doubly linked list, pointers go both ways.

Difference between linked list and arrays
- A linked list does not provide constant time to access to a 'index'. So that when you need
  to find the k-th element of a linked list, you need to iterate through k nodes to get there.
