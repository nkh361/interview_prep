Linked List

A linked list is a sequence of data elements, called nodes. Each node is connected to another
through a pointer. This would create a sequence of nodes.

Different types of linked lists:
  - Singly: linked list in which each node points to the next node and the last node points
            to null
  - Doubly: linked list in which each node has two pointers, p and n, such that p points to
            the previous node and n points to the next node; the last node's n pointer points
            to null
  - Circular: linked list in which each node points to the next node and the last node points
              back to the first node
